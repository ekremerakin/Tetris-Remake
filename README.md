# Tetris-Remake

Hello!

In this repository, I tried to build a tetris game with using Java programming language.

During the programming process, I tried not to write hundred lines of codes for just 
rotating the tetris pieces. Instead, I tried to write some methods that I can use for 
different tetris pieces.

Note: The ways that I created to solve the problems could not be the best ways to solve 
that problems. This project was built for practice.
